:warning: this work has been folded into the [`espresso-support`](https://github.com/novoda/spikes/tree/master/espresso-support) spike. There's not much value in toggling TalkBack outside of tests, and that library is open for further state setting (e.g. non-touch vs touch mode).

Turn Android Talkback on and off simply by sending an intent!

## Description

We want to be able to turn TalkBack on and off programmatically so we can run connected Android tests on them without leaving devices in an inconsistent state.

- `TalkBackStateSettingActivity` toggles the service on and off. It responds to an intent (see below), after permission has been granted on the app.
- `TalkBackActivityTestRule` (from `talkback-toggle-espresso`) can be used in your espresso tests to automatically enable TalkBack for each test and disable after

## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

android {
    testBuildType 'espresso'
}

dependencies {
    espressoCompile 'com.novoda:talkback-toggle:<latest-version>' // the core library
    androidTestCompile 'com.novoda:talkback-toggle-espresso:<latest-version>' // if you need the TalkBackActivityTestRule
}
```

You'll need to be using a specific build type for your connected tests, like `espresso` above. This is because the library must be included in the main sourceset of the application to respond to intents and without a specific variant, your production APK will be requesting a system permission (write secure settings).

If working on the tests from the IDE, it's necessary to select this build type from the build variants menu.

## Simple usage

The library works by modifying system settings which means you'll need to set the permission on your app using ADB. Assuming the package name for the `espresso` build above is `com.novoda.movies`, you can set the permissions as follows:

```bash
adb shell pm grant com.novoda.movies android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
```

You can enable/disable TalkBack via adb with the following actions:

```bash
$ adb shell am start -a "com.novoda.talkbacktoggle.ENABLE_TALKBACK"
$ adb shell am start -a "com.novoda.talkbacktoggle.DISABLE_TALKBACK"
```

You can also do the same with an Intent:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent("com.novoda.talkbacktoggle.ENABLE_TALKBACK")
context.startActivity(intent);
```

## Demo

You can run the demo tests with the following commands:

```bash
./gradlew demo:installEspresso; adb shell pm grant com.novoda.movies android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS; adb shell am start -a "com.novoda.talkbacktoggle.DISABLE_TALKBACK"; ./gradlew demo:cAT; adb shell am start -a "com.novoda.talkbacktoggle.DISABLE_TALKBACK";
```

You have to install the app first to set the permission. We also disable TalkBack before and after the tests so we don't mess up non-TalkBack tests.
