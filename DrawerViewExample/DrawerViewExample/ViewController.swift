        This adds a simple "DrawerView" or bottom sheet behaviour to iOS projects.
        
        The integration is relatively simple, and relies on constraints making it a bit more robust.
        
        To integrate it you must:
        - Add a "peek view" which is the view always shown (red in the movie)
        - Add a "content view" which can be shown when dragged (green; this is automatically scrollable)
        - Set the constraint which will be animatable.
        
        The API includes a basic delegate which can be used to add a dimming background view, as shown.
